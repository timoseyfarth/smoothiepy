class FixationSmoothFilter1D(Filter1D):

    A filter class to smooth fixation-like data in 1D. This is a type of deadband filter.

    It uses a weighted averaging mechanism in conjunction with standard deviation-based
    thresholding to determine whether to maintain or update the fixation value. The purpose
    of this filter is to smooth out noise while preserving significant data trends.

    The noise will be reduced by checking the standard deviation of the data in the buffer
    and comparing the latest data value with the current fixation value. If both checks pass,
    the current fixation value is returned. Otherwise, a new fixation value is computed
    using a weighted average of the data in the buffer.

    Note that this filter cuts out noise totally. It will not smooth out noise.

    An example for the threshold would be calculated using the following formula:
    ``{screen_width_px} * 0.004 + sqrt({window_size})``.
    Where `screen_width_px` is the width of the screen in pixels and
    `window_size` is the size of the sliding window used for the filter.
    This could be used for eye-tracking data to smooth out noise when you fixate on a point
